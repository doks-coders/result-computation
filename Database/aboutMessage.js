<b>Web Links</b>

Here you specify a web link for the website you would want us to extract information from. We will then give special instructions to our computers to automatically collect 
specific information from the website.

<b>Records:</b>
</span>
In our service, records are like individual pieces of information we collect. 
For example, if you want to extract the prices and names of items from a website for research, each item would be a record. 
For example, if we collect 500 items, it means we have 500 records.<br> <b>Note:</b> We can add more records, but that will incur a higher price.

<b>Data Cleaning and Export:</b>
</span>
After collecting the data, we carefully check it for mistakes or unwanted things. 
We make sure the data is accurate and remove any unnecessary or incorrect parts. 
Then, we organize the data and put it into an excel file, for research purposes

<b>Requests</b>
</span>
The "requests" in our packages tell you how many times we can collect data for you. 
It depends on the package you choose. For example, if you choose the Newbie package,
 we can collect data only once. But if you choose the Standard package, 
 we can collect data up to four times, 
which means you have more chances to get the information you want.</p>
